My thesis project



Having a list of games' ASINs:
- from terminal: 
      perl downloadAmazonReviews.pl com ASIN1 ASIN2 ASIN3...
	    perl extractAmazonReviews.pl com amazonreviews/com/ASIN1 	amazonreviews/com/ASIN2 	amazonreviews/com/ASIN3...
  obtaining file reviews.txt
  
  

FOR USERS:
- run UsersGenerator --> creates a list of user's ASINS from the reviews (not sorted)
- from terminal:
      <usersToSort.txt sort | uniq > sortedUsers.txt 
  obtaining file sortedUsers.txt (list of sorted users without duplicates)
  
- run UsersAppender --> adds a numeric userID to each user's ASIN in the list



FOR GAMES:
- copy the list of ASINs and game names from the BrowseNode page
- from terminal: 
        <gamesToSort.txt sort | uniq > sortedGames.txt

- run Appender --> adds unique numeric IDs to the list.



GENERATING THE RATINGS FILE
- run parserCSV --> creates file ratings.txt: each line represent a rating and is composed by userID, gameID, rating
